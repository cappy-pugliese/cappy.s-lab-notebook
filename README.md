- read papers to learn more about WNS
- looked at [https://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/](https://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/)

#### Learned how to use github
- started making these weekly updates and pushing commits to github
- also made my own website (took a while) using github and editted info on the lab website

#### Learned how to use the cluster
- learned how to navigate around my computer on the terminal
- watched xanadu intro videos
- learned how to log into the cluster
- got familiar with bash
- learned how to make directories and edit files among other things

#### Learned about NCBI and Quality checking
- got used to finding samples on NCBI
- learned about fastqc and how to interpret the output html file
  - also had to learn how to transfer files from the cluster to my laptop

#### Followed Dagilis's WNS tutorial
- short-read sample analysis pipeline using one sample to start with
- learned how to download sample from NCBI onto the cluster (fastq-dump)
- learned how to trim sequences (bbduk)
- learned how to align to reference
  - created sam/bam files using bwa-mem, picard, samtools
- varient calling with mpileup and GATK pipeline

### 2025 Spring Semester

#### Courses
- took EEB 5300: Practical Genomics
  - learned *a lot* about bioinformatics methods that relate to my project
  - learned how to write and submit scripts on the cluster (and got a lot of practice)
  - got a lot of practice with trouble shooting
  
#### Research Committee
- made research committee
- had our first meeting at the end of the semester
  - practiced presenting my project a couple of times during lab meeting and during my research committee meeting
  - reread landscaping genomics methods papers to better understand what I plan on doing
  
#### Scripts
- made some scripts to start off the pipeline from where Andrius left off
  1. indexed bam files with samtools
  2. generated g.vcfs with haplotypecaller
  3. working on finishing the GATK pipeline
- downloaded some climatic data
- added in some missing lat long location data
  - still need to work on adding in the rest
