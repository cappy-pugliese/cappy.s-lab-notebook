### This Week
#### 11/17
- took my cat on a hike :)
- worked on 3rd grade outreach presentation
- updated last week's weekly update

#### 11/18
- dentist appointment
- worked more on my preproposal

#### 11/19
- made symlinks to get to the lab directory and the PD genome reference folder
- was going to try to use the files in the reference folder run the bwa mem command, but I quickly ran into permissions issues
- created a reference dict with picard
- indexed with bwa
- bwa mem command still "could not locate index files"
  - banged my head against a wall for an hour while I tried to troubleshoot again
    - had trouble naming the location of the index files
    - then started running into a "command not found" error
      - I had accidentally included "bash-4.2$" text in my code at some point because of a copy error
    - ended up putting all the files in one folder out of frustration
    - finally realized I had a copy error
    - finally got things working
