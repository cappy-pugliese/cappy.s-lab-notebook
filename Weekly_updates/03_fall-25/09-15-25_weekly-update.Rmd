### This week
#### Monday
- now have vcf files
- need to do some filtering
  - run qc analysis first (vcfr/bcftools stats)
- ran bcftools-stats on the vcf file
  - was able to use the plot-vcfstats tool to generate some plots of the data (it took me a while to figure out how to view the plots but they were right in front of my face after running the plot.py code)
  
#### Tuesday
- ran the same bcftools-stats/plot-vcfstats on the vcf file that was generated with ploidy = 1
  - downloaded to mac but have yet to run the plots
