### This week 12/01 - 12/05

#### Monday (12/01)

-   started to redo pcangsd without non-pd samples

    -   started rerunning the vcf making process

    -   turns out I didn't need to do that lol

### Tuesday (12/02)

-   new vcf without non-pd samples had finished running

    -   doing some bcftools stats analysis

    -   going a little bit more in depth than last time because I'm trying to figure out what the results mean myself

    -   found a [script](https://mubashir3164.github.io/tutorials/vcf_analysis_tutorial.html) to help with analyzing the vcf, courtesy of [Mubashir Abbas](https://github.com/Mubashir3164) on github

        -   running the script does take a little bit, and I did not realize it also needed vcftools in addition to bcftools at first

### Thursday (12/04)

-   edited stats script and played around with it a bit, also put it running

-   put a filtering script running for the new vcf

-   put a plink script running for the new vcf
