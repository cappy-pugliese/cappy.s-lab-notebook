### This week
#### Weekend
- worked on some grading for bio 1108
- read book for grad 6001

#### Tuesday
- read book for grad 6001
- submitted assignments for popgen

#### Friday
- it worked, but I realized there was actually more missing than I originally thought
- merged the ones that did run into the folder with the others
- created a new script to run the rest of the missing files
- put it running

### Monday
- everything worked, except for a handful of files
  - those files did not exist in the bam folder to begin with so it couldn't work anyway
  - unsure what to do about the missing files
