### This week (9/2 - 9/5)
#### Weekend
- worked on some grading for bio 1108
- read book for grad 6001

#### Tuesday
- read book for grad 6001
- submitted assignments for popgen

#### Friday
- it worked, but I realized there was actually more missing than I originally thought
- merged the ones that did run into the folder with the others
- created a new script to run the rest of the missing files
- put it running

### Week 2 (9/8 - 9/12)
#### Monday
- everything worked, except for a handful of files
  - those files did not exist in the bam folder to begin with so it couldn't work anyway
  - unsure what to do about the missing files
- lab meeting, stuff to do for next week:
  - finish running the data
  - genomics dv
  - data analysis with pixy or pcangst
  - vcfr for figures
  - start playing around with the data
  - maybe build a tree out of the data
