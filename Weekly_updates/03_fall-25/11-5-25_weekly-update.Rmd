### This week 11/3-11/7

#### Monday (11/3)

-   ran test iqtree script, worked perfectly fine
-   was able to use seff to figure out how many cores and how much mem I should ask for
-   reran pipe_to_slurm with these new constraints
-   briefly tried to reorganize some of the output, but it was too much to do it all by hand so I stopped
    -   tried to run a couple of the iqtree scripts at the same time
    -   once I figured out how to run them, put them running but they all quit very quickly

#### Wednesday (11/5)

-   realized I didn't have a specified log folder so the scripts were quitting before they could run
-   trying to make changes so I can run them with parallel instead of running them all at the same time
-   I was able to run them with parallel, but they still all ran at the same time??? Not sure why. Kind of defeats the whole purpose of doing that.
-   6/10 of the runs failed with some weird error. Was not able to find solution for the error online. Other people had the same question but neither had been answered.

```{bash}
ERROR: modelfactory.cpp:1131: virtual bool ModelFactory::initFromNestedModel(std::map<std::__cxx11::basic_string<char>, std::vector<std::__cxx11::basic_string<char> > >): Assertion `itr != checkpoint->end()' failed.
ERROR: STACK TRACE FOR DEBUGGING:

```

#### Thursday (11/6)

-   tried to briefly troubleshoot iqtree, with no luck

-   tried to get some more lat-long data points, didn't get super far because I had to jump down a lot of rabbit holes

#### Friday (11/7)

-   took Andrius's advice and started annotating some of the sources I had found with zotero

### Week 11/10 - 11/14

#### Monday (11/10)

-   annotated some more sources
