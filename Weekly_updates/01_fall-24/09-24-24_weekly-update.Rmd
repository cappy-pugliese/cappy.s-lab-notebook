### This week
#### 9/24
- messed around in Rmarkdown
- watched some more xanadu tutorials

#### 9/25
- read a bit of the assigned lab paper
- did a WNS paper search and signed up for email alerts
- messed around a bit more in Rmarkdown
- attempted to look into fastqc file error again
  - looks like both the files I downloaded might be multi-line fastq files, and fastQC is not able to process that file format
  - may be possible to convert the file format using software??
    - bioruby??

#### 9/26
- tried to read lab paper but was not in a productive reading mode, so worked on homework instead

#### 9/27
- finished reading the rest of the lab paper
