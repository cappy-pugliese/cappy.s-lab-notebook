### Last week (3/24 - 3/28)
- got sick, did not get much done
- it's been a while since I've done a weekly update since I've been swamped with a lot of work lately and haven't been able to keep up

### This week
## Monday 3/31
- started working on my group project for Jill's genomics class
- sent a bunch of class emails
- did collections tour training for bio 1108
- very briefly checked in on my xanadu lab directory since it has been a while
  - slightly reorganized some stuff to make things easier to navigate
