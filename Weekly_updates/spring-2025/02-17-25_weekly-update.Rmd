### Last week (2/10 - 2-14)
- went to grad craft night for the first time, it was very nice
- had my first one-on-one lab meeting of the semester with Andrius
  - lab goals:
    - work on picking research committee members
    - work on getting the lat-long wns data (possibly email and ask)
    - keep on reading
- taught a lot during tutoring hours
  - went overtime a little bit, might need to start being a bit more upfront about how long the tutoring sessions are
- EEB 5300
  - learned about different databases and a bit more about utilizing NCBI
  - worked with navigating around NCBI and looking at genomes
  - learned how to submit a job through SLURM

### For this week
- still struggling a bit to juggle schoolwork and teaching
