## This week 1/26 - 1/30

todos:
- need to edit the scripts to get rid of the slurm headers in order for them to work with the slurm array
  - edit the pipe2slurm script to turn them into .sh (no slurm headers) instead of .sbatch

- focus on algatr

### Monday (1/26)
- looked through algatr stuff again
  - discovered that the `do_everything_for_me()` code I had tried to use last time failed because the vector memory limit of my laptop had been reached, so if I want to test everything out, I'd probably need to do it on the cluster
  - decided to go through the TESS vignette portion of the tutorial
    - recommended ld pruning my vcf
    - tried to ld prune using the algatr software but was having difficulty
    - decided to try to ld prune using plink instead and output a new vcf
      - transferred ld pruned vcf file onto my laptop from cluster
