## This week 2/9 - 2/13

### focus on
- MMRR and GGM --> might take longer
    - ***migration rate method from MMRR
    - focus on MMRR first
- try to start writing
    - begining of methods
- (wingen after)

### Monday (2/9)
- worked on and finished the MMRR portion
  - one of the graphs I got using the "full" model came out wonky, but all of the graphs came out fine when I used the "best" model
  - the graphs came out differently than expected, it seems like there is some (odd?) grouping happening

### focus on (from last week)
-   [] pc plot with ancestries
-   [] cut off the wisconsin sample for wingen
